doesn't really work.\n1:44: Yeah, maybe 11 here would be this image is louder than that one.\n1:49: Now, sometimes we use the word I actually personally use the word loud sometimes to mean something

know, set of values here in order to say that something is the wrong note, right?\n1:42: So like it has the same,, typological structure, mostly or like a very close typological structure.\n1:49: They're both like subtypes or something of like a a super class,.\n1:53: , as you know, something like, oh, you know, if you have such and such goals, then you should do this.\n2:01: It's to say, well, in musical performance in isolation cannot be said to be wrong.\n2:07: You can say, well, if you're like we could constructed as, if your goal was to play this piece of music as written.\n2:15: Then indeed you have done so incorrectly, or you have not done so according to spec, right?\n2:21: So conformance to a specification, right?\n2:24: And that's fine.\n2:24: I mean, it's like very useful concept.\n2:26: There's obviously a lot more nuance in what we want in musical performance, but at least we could say yes, they did not conform to the spec.\n2:32: There was a spec as in a written.\n2:34: A written piece and then you did something other than that, right?\n2:39: And we have some like, you know, sort of nebulosity as to like exactly what constitutes that as in like, for example, you know, tuning is imprecise,, well, did you play it in a different key?\n2:50: Oh, in fact, are you in a different sort of like, not either are you in a different tuning system, but also like people's voices are not tuned precisely anyhow,.\n2:58: , are you in a different, you know, concert pitch, and so on, but we have like a range of acceptable senses of right and wrong and like, oh no, that was off by a 4th, that was a wrong note, or even that was off actually by a minor 2 is still that was the wrong note.\n3:16: ,,, and indeed, but however, so very obvious, you know, construction here is indeed in something like jazz, as they say, there is no such thing as a wrong note.\n3:30: And we were sort of only concerned with.\n3:33: ,, the sort of like harmoniousness of the composition altogether, but even harmoniousness is nuanced, right?\n3:45: I'm actually gonna write something down."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"0:00: Right, so jazz is jazz is a sort of marvelous example here because like,, they just sort of like actually like that discourse does not make use of the notion of wrong in the same way at all.\n0:11: And in fact, to my sort of shallow understanding, like they actually don't use the word wrong very much.\n0:19: It's more like good, right?\n0:20: They're much more likely to say good, beautiful, harmonious, whatever, and and it's that's really beautiful and it's like it's really it's just really right indeed, if you play to spec it you wouldn't say so much that it's bad is that you haven't even It's not jazz yet, right?\n0:37: Like if you played a a a chart exactly as written, you have sort of, you've done none of the work of making the art of it, which is indeed of the interpretation, right?\n0:48: If you literally just play the notes as written, and even if you actually like, well, I mean, OK, fine, you can play the notes as written and you can play them quite nicely, but you haven't really played jazz, right?\n0:59: You played the song that was fine, that was good.\n1:01: No, no, no, now let's get to the work of making the jazz of it, right?\n1:04: ,, and then we, what we have here is, OK, well, now we have, right, a utility function.\n1:12: We have a valuation, a loss function, and evaluation function depending on how we want the sign to be written or which sign we want to use,.\n1:19: ,, over.\n1:23: , over, you know, interpretations, right?\n1:26: And there's like different styles, there's different traditions, and you can get really abstruse, right?\n1:32: Like you can get like really out there and if it's like legible within a like communicative system.\n1:39: Then indeed, etc.\n1:41: like that will be said to be a beautiful.\n1:45: Maybe they don't use the word the word beautiful, but whatever, a beautiful interpretation of a piece, and indeed there's no such thing as a wrong note.\n1:51: Now you can say now they're still going to sometimes use the word wrong note, like, oh indeed that wasn't what I planned to do, and it didn't really go that well.\n1:58: And like, yeah, fine, that's a wrong note.\n1:59: OK, sure.\n2:00: And they're gonna use the same word and indeed like, you don't start playing jazz, you start playing.\n2:06: You know, things as written and you gotta like learn your scales and like they still care a lot about playing what they exactly what they care about playing what they want to play like they're not just fucking around.\n2:16: It's like very, very fine, very, very controlled, but nonetheless,.\n2:22: The notion of correct doesn't apply there, right?\n2:27: Or or at least it's not used in that discourse and and it stops actually making any making sense."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"0:00: OK, great.\n0:01: So,,, Oh

down in my file as well, is there's this quote from a Greek philosopher somewhere that I found on Twitter.\n0:09: I'm gonna,, one second.\n0:37: OK, great.\n0:37: So,, right, and, and he's like,.\n0:42: You know, oh, these sort of adults, these idiots, they think that they can uncultured or whatever, they think that they can just make music that feels good,, and oh this is great.\n0:54: Oh I love where I'm going with this.\n0:55: This is, this is why I had these thoughts before, sorry, this is great.\n0:58: , it's actually working a lot better than I thought it would.\n1:00: So they think that they can just make music that feels good.\n1:05: It's rousing to the spirits,, and they don't understand that their music is wrong.\n1:10: It's mathematically wrong because music has to have certain mathematical relationships and theirs defiant.\n1:16: OK, and so like this strikes us as just, sorry, that's the end of the quote.\n1:19: It strikes us as immediately obviously a joke.\n1:21: I want to elaborate on a point here.\n1:23: I'm gonna labor on this point in particular.\n1:25: If we take the history of Western music since the common practice period.\n1:30: Or since the sort of outset of the common practice period, and this is like so important, is that it is one revolution after another of breaking the rules, right?\n1:40: The our, our, our like our sort of like, well, it's, it's interesting, of course, because, you know, so-called classical music.\n1:48: of course, at every stage, like, incredibly modern, right?\n1:52: Like every, every, every renowned classical composer is, is known because they weren't just making, they weren't simply following the forms.\n2:01: They were like exactly breaking the rules and people said, oh, that's beautiful.\n2:04: Oh, that's incredible, right?\n2:06: ,, and this, and it's this sort of like sacred part of Western culture, at least for a lot of people,, is this like tradition which is like fundamentally innovative, right?\n2:19: It's all sort of like,, raison dre is innovation.\n2:24: The, the, the thing that distinguishes it,, the thing, the thing that they valorize most now to the point of sort of degeneracy because like contemporary classical music is often like.\n2:35: Kind of opaque to people though that's often true at it I mean that there's a separate point here that like when when things come out people often are offended.\n2:43: So like even Bach, which is which is sort of like the, you know, the What is it?\n2:50: , I think it's the 4, you like sustain the, the 4 into the 57, or you see the 4 into the 5 and then you call it a 57, right?\n3:05: The 4th, the 4th degree and then you call that that that's like the 7th, 7th or the 4th note of your, of your 5, you're extending the 5 triad, right?\n3:15: .\n3:15: , then even that I think was sort of like people didn't like it and indeed there's like when you read histories of, you know, classical musicians that indeed,, you know, a lot of like what, like there's all these cases where people were like offended and they would like walk out in the middle of performances and so on and so like, OK, well there's something funny going on with the signaling of like, like contemporary, you know, classical it's written today, it's like really avant garde and we hit kind of the extent of avant garde with like, you know.\n3:43: , you know, free rhythm and, and, and, and atonality and Whatever.\n3:50: this is like I'm not gonna labor this point too much, but the point here is to say,, that like indeed, both, OK, well we find that this Greek philosopher's name I can't remember,, is like, you know, it's ridiculous, right?\n4:03: You listen to that you're like, oh what a fucking, oh my God, what a fucking meme, like what an absolute shit lord, right?\n4:09: But people actually say things like this.\n4:12: They say things to some extent even about music, right?\n4:15: You, you, you played this wrong.\n4:17: And they'd say it in a way as though it's, that is a unqualified and B as though it's absolute, right?\n4:22: They didn't know it's fine to say in the same way that it's fine to say, given some set of goals, these things will satisfy those goals under utility function, you can, you know, here's the local optimum, local or global optimum.\n4:37: Right?\n4:38: But you can't say this is the optimum absolutely.\n4:41: You can't say this is the choice that should be making res be made irrespective of all goals.\n4:47: It's just like not, it's it's like no meaningful notion.\n4:50: Now you, you might, there might be some things where you say for this large class of goals, they all have an optim here.\n4:55: There are some domains that are like this, that's true."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"0:00: Right, so this is the choice that should be made irrespective.\n0:02: I got cut off the, the file just it stopped recording me.\n0:05: This is the choice

I don't know exactly to construct this, right?\n0:19: So what we have here also is the thing with the it's not Pythagoras, some fucking stupid Greek is like he's like, oh yeah, I'm not racist against ancient Greek.\n0:27: I don't, you know, whatever,.\n0:28: , is it he's made a type error there, right?\n0:32: OK, fine.\n0:32: So,.\n0:33: , you find people, you, you find people sometimes in the context of, of music and temporarily, and, and, and often this is like more nuanced and this is like when, you know, if a teacher is frustrated or something, you, you, this is wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, you can't do that.\n0:47: ,, and it's, and it's not offered in a way that's qualified as, you know, if you want to play it as written, then indeed that's wrong.\n1:02: Oh, I think there's a point here that I want to elaborate, which is something like, indeed, at some level, right, so in the same way that like jazz is all about, well, you didn't play it as written and you can break the rules in this beautiful way,.\n1:16: Or at least it had, that has been the the shtick for some time, for like at least like 70 years or so,, more than that.\n1:22: Yeah, that's probably right, that's probably the right place to start.\n1:26: Whatever, nonsense,.\n1:34: Anyway,."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"0:00: Right, so at a different sort of like at a different resolution, and a different time resolution,, also, like Western classical music is in general is about,, OK, well, you know, did you, what not just is it correct, is it according to spec, you can write things according to spec.\n0:17: There are like some pretty narrow rules that define common practice period,, compositional rules, but nonetheless, it's rather,,, you know, is it harmonious?\n0:31: That's the criteria.\n0:32: I is it harmonious?\n0:33: So so the goal, I mean, it's not now it's like, right, so if you want to talk about music, like, is that good?\n0:38: Again, it's actually just with respect to some goals and it's just, was it pleasing?\n0:42: Was it pleasing, satisfying, riveting.\n0:47: Pleasant, might be just like, oh, that was just enormously chill.\n0:51: That was it put me asleep, right?\n0:53: So that can be very negative and it can be very positive.\n0:55: Oh, I love this music to fall asleep to.\n0:57: It's so wonderful.\n0:58: It puts me to sleep so wonderfully.\n1:00: Or you can say, oh, I saw this movie, it put me to sleep.\n1:03: It's horrible, right?\n1:04: So no, it's just like, OK, it's also with respect to like what you wanted out of that at the time, or maybe you didn't even know you wanted it and nonetheless, something about it was satisfying or some something good.\n1:15: What we mean here is with respect to some set of goals or values, some utility function, etc.\n1:20: you know, was it preferred?\n1:23: Was it, you know, did it, did it, you know, far better according to this sort of evaluation function."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"0:00: OK, so, indeed, this is a very important point and, well, OK, indeed this is still this is still contentious and so you'll find people and this is where I would sort of like quote the the people that,,, Scott was responding to recently in his post discussing taste,.\n0:18: , that you'll find people who are like trying to justify taste as sort of like more deeply real,.\n0:29: Sort of like more profoundly like just just definite and like grounded and real than, you know, not pleasing to me and contrary to this sort of like contemporarily accepted styles or something, right?\n0:44: And it's just like, no, no, OK, now, now maybe, I don't know, I don't feel utterly confident about this point.\n0:49: I'm actually not necessarily going to labor the point about aesthetics and in some point way here, I feel as though maybe my argument doesn't, doesn't sort of hold,.\n1:01: I'm gonna follow this point and maybe if it doesn't sort of hold together perfectly, it's like I, I don't

exactly how I started this earlier, but it, I was gonna talk about the word wrong, right, yeah, so I started talking about the word wrong and we went on this whole tangent about wrong note and then it's like, oh right, OK, so,.\n0:15: Right, we can say wrong as in,, like, like low confident, like, like a low very low probability that I expect, you know, prediction to be borne out, or we can say something like You know, indeed, like a false theorem.\n0:34: Right, a false proposition.\n0:36: OK, right,,, and like the point here is not to be the language police, right?\n0:42: But it's like, oh, when you say, and I'm fine with saying wrong note, and there is a sort of narrow technical definition of wrong note and I'm fine also, but, and like indeed I'm also fine with saying that fucking that song fucking sucked, that fucking sucked, dude, you know, that like sure nobody likes the no no.\n1:02: Yeah,, right.\n1:03: , but no, so the thing that we want to say here is.\n1:07: , You know,,.\n1:10: , what do I want to say?\n1:26: , Right, it's it it it's like it's not.\n1:32: Is it, is it so indeed it like, like, is it is that people will say things with a tone.\n1:39: I think there's a, there's a nuance here which I might may or may not forget to capture.\n1:42: , I don't know, I'm not gonna be, I'm gonna finish this point.\n1:45: So people will say things with a tone in any language as though they mean logically necessary or empirically true for various sense of empirically true, and what they actually mean is either unstrategic.\n2:03: These are also actually, yeah, that's two types that I want to be able to distinguish, right?\n2:05: So unstrategic and dispreferred, right?\n2:10: So those are unstrategic and dispreferred are like with respect to like the same sort of domain but at like two levels of abstraction or like with two different kinds of qualification.\n2:20: So when I say dispreferred that sort of like has already assumed.\n2:24: ,,, the utility function, we say like under a utility function this under under this utility function, indeed this is dispreferred, you're like, you know, that that is dispreferred I should say, and then separately we would want to be able to distinguish,, like, well, given my model of the domain.\n2:49: And like for that utility function, such an action is,, unstrategic.\n3:00: Right?\n3:01: So, again, we want probably unstrategic and dispreferred, and both of those, nonetheless are not, cannot be said in absolute, in the absolute.\n3:11: They always mean.\n3:12: ,, You know, with respect to a utility function or or something or or something equivalent or something."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"0:00: One thing that's occurring to me as I'm as I'm here is something like, actually I might want

language he uses.\n0:34: , that's like, you know, sometimes people will say, oh, so this is where we go to the third level, right?\n0:41: So we're like, first, you know, first level is logic, second level is empirical, 3rd level is strategic.\n0:49: Fourth level is like values.\n0:52: , And then 5th level, and maybe I don't know, and this is where it gets confusing, but it's something like, you know,.\n1:00: , You know, like,,,.\n1:24: Well, lots of things, lots of feelings and thoughts,.\n1:28: You know, like, like, oh, is this the sort of correct,, correct values, right?\n1:34: So, so, so,

universal law, by Dharma.\n1:47: The Dharma contradicts, it goes against the Dharma.\n1:50: It goes against the word of God.\n1:52: Or they, right?\n1:53: , and I think that actually sort of like these, these are the, the reason why they're needing to say it with such force is that this is like a sort of like a social, there's like a social, like a speech act, right?\n2:05: That is trying to kind of like It's it's the opposite of untying the Gordian knot, right?\n2:11: It's, it's rather like they're trying to tie the Gordian knot.\n2:14: They're trying to tie a knot in what is an unknot.\n2:20: OK, that, that's not gonna make an end, but it's great.\n2:22: I love that.\n2:22: I love fucking love that.\n2:24: They're trying to tie and unnot.\n2:29: Yeah No, I mean, I might include that tie it or not.\n2:37: I sucking my head so sick.\n2:38: I'm so basic.\n2:39: , Right, and then they just say, oh well, you know, values that are beyond yours that you can't argue with or something.\n2:48: And it has this sort of like affective psychological consequence of like, you know, people people will submit to them unfortunately.\n2:55: , and I'll say just like, no, I think this is wrong, right?\n2:58: You cannot make claims sort of like purely in the abstract about value and principle.\n3:04: And so like this is where we're gonna get like.\n3:06: You know, minds that that there's like an Eliezer post here that's like mines.\n3:12: So I wanna say about tying, like tying an unknot.\n3:14: I want to link to the Wikipedia page for unknot,, and so like, yeah, for like a Y

arguments from nowhere, but it's like.\n3:30: , our perspective from nowhere, like, like universally compelling arguments or something universal, yeah, universally compelling arguments, I think is the title of the post.\n3:40: And it's just like, yeah, you can't make an argument.\n3:43: You can't, you can't like assume a value,.\n3:48: Like holds in principle.\n3:49: It's like that's like that that is a type error, right?\n3:52: It is not, it is, it's always the case that you could just like define a utility function with a negative sign in front of it.\n4:01: You're a negative sign in front of it.\n4:03: Now, now there is, and this is where we're going to get in trouble.\n4:06: I'm gonna talk about this later, is like you can say something like, no, I believe you are confused about your own
