### planned posts

- [x] maybe: "spiritual rationality" > epistemic rationality + instrumental rationality
	- [x] maybe just rename the sequence actually
- [x] sketch of a typology of correctness
	- [x] More like "a sketch of some types of correctness" rather than typology
- [ ] why metaphysics?
		- [ ] everyone is concerned with metaphysics
- [ ] against naive rationalist metaphysics
- [ ] ontological mistakes wrt phenomenology
	- [ ] the reification post goes in here
	- [ ] re like, mistaking or equivocating between physical correlates and qualia
	- [ ] often also assuming the hard problem of consciousness to be solved etc
		- [ ] (note hippies make this same error often)
			- [ ] there's some broader point re like, I'm making critiques addressed to rats, or with respect to a much broader discourse, but it's not as though hippies are "winning" here (I think nny is relatively "winning" tho lol)
- [ ] the basic claims of wayfinding
- [ ] metaphysical harms
- [ ] "coherence" as a concept, can probably link to kaj
- [ ] "structure preserving on some subspace"
	- [ ] we can say, certainly, that there's modifications which are not desirable, which we would consider an abomination, and indeed if we said "take this substrate and modify it such that the consciousness running on it is utterly different" that this is basically equivalent to death--I think most ppl would have this intuition
- [ ] something like "gnosis, deference, inference, and confabulation"
	- [ ] something something, ppl can't distinguish what kinds of knowledge they're working with, make inferences inappropriately, and then reify those etc
	- [ ] https://substack.com/@charlieawbery/p-148053464
		- 2024-09-01 the short verison of this recording is like, at least in vajrayana, gurus often require submission, which isn't even necessarily required for transmission
- [ ] "wrong practice" (this sort of comes after typology of correctness)
- [ ] everyone is concerned with transformative practice
	- [ ] what is practice for?
- [ ] trying to actually do some empiricism
	- [ ] "95% confidence interval, ~98% of those practitioners who attend at least one meditation retreat make &le; 1 sigma gains in neuroticism over 20 years " (2024-08-02 current bs guess)
- [ ] harms associated with normative claims, "the burdens of meaning"
- [ ] I think I want to include a bunch of my blog posts just in the book unaltered
  - [ ] including "attempting to deconstruct real", "reification", "inappropriate dereification", "what should be reified", and *maybe* "view
    - [ ] I think potentially a bunch of these can get folded into other posts but it's going to be necessary to have the content in the body of the book and not be like "yeah here's a blog post you can read"
  - [ ] a bunch of these are basically just part of a section on metaphysics or something. "phenomenal metaphysics"
- [ ] american dharma, "whose buddha", "the buddha", historiography, textual criticism, etc.
  - [ ] but also western buddhism in particular
- [ ] a catalog of empirical, phenomenological, and metaphysical claims made by various traditions
  - [ ] my sense, in evaluating these
