[I think it's not clear if the correctness post needs to come first here]
--[I think it does, since I want to talk about transformation etc]


There are two very different concepts which I want to distinguish here clearly, which is why they're on the same page.

voice notes:
0:00: OK, great.
 0:01: So the next one is titled Spiritual rationality and rational spirituality,.
 0:10: Yeah, maybe I'm gonna get my other headphones.

0:00: OK, great.
 0:00: So part of the thing here is that I want to distinguish between two things clearly, and part of the thing is just also that these are both useful concepts and we're going to talk about both of them,, later, you know, further in the piece, but I'll just get you gonna introduce what are these two concepts.
 0:13: , OK, so,.
 0:17: Great.
 0:17: So first one is spiritual rationality, and I came up with this nice bit, which is the third leg of the stool, right?
 0:22: So,, you know, whatever stool needs 3, got a balance on 3 tripod, tripod, whatever.
 0:29: .
 0:31: Tripod physics, I guess,, 3, you know, 3 points make a plane.
 0:35: We're not in our 3, so it doesn't really work anyway it doesn't matter.
 0:38: So third leg of the stool, right?
 0:40: So the problem is.
 0:41: ,,, you know, like.
 0:51: It's not just enough to say what is it?
 0:55: And and maybe something like how should we do whatever what it is that we want or I don't know, that's not great, right?
 1:02: But it's it's like, you know, we might want to say it's like we want to say like, you know, what, what is, what is the case?
 1:08: What is the case, and we want to make this distinction.
 1:10: I mean, and I made this distinction very clearly in the like typology of.
 1:16: Whatever post, I don't know, or whatever I titled it,, typologies of correctness.
 1:21: ,,,, You know, yeah, so we want to make a distinction between,,,,,, right, OK, so we, you know, we want to make a distinction between like, like.
 2:10: Like, yeah, I rationality and instrumental rationality, right?
 2:15: And so the the thing here is that like, you know, OK, what is the case is like relatively intuitive, but like, you know, what the other is like, OK, well, what should you do?
 2:24: But it's always what should you do given some set of values, right?
 2:28: And so the problem here is not just to say, OK, well, you know, indeed I have some set of values, that's not adequate,.
 2:35: ,, right, so like the, like, like in like, like, and this is in fact part of the problem, one of the problems that people have, oh, I, yeah, I should say I have a, well, I'm gonna write this down also actually.

0:00: OK, there was a, there was a separate thing I needed to write down, so,.
 0:03: , you know, one of the things that confuses people when we talk about instrumental rationality is that it instrumental rationality is to a large extent,, agnostic with respect to your values, and this is correct in a certain sense, right?
 0:18: So one can simply have different values and if you assume that, you know, someone is making poor choices and you like, but you like leave out the fact that they may have different values at some level of abstraction, then etc.
 0:30: etc.
 0:31: and indeed Eliezer has discussed like, you know, blah blah blah.
 0:35: , you know,, Sorry, let me push that.
 0:41: I don't know.
 0:54: OK, great.
 0:55: So,, Wait, I don't even remember what I was gonna say there.

0:00: Yeah, OK, right.
 0:01: So, you know, this mind can zig, that mind can zag, you can stick a negative sign in front of your loss function.
 0:07: But,, still there's this problem, right?
 0:09: Cause like, you know, we have this notion as humans, right, of like something like moral sort of like rightness.
 0:17: Rightness, right?
 0:18: So like we have a sense of like both like like there's like shame, shame in a positive sense of like, like dismay at one's actions.
 0:24: I should not have done that.
 0:25: I will fix that.
 0:26: It's just like whatever there's like a maybe I could link to G and Otapatapa there but like whatever.
 0:32: But you know, like, right, so like there's like there's like dismay at one's own behavior, there's dismay at others' behavior, there's some sense of like we we like we like make normative claims.
 0:40: I don't want to say that there is no room for normative claims.
 0:43: Like at some level, in the ways that I interact with the world, I'm like, no claims are often harmful.
 0:48: I think they are often quite harmful,.
 0:52: So I'm gonna write that down also.

0:00: But like, right, OK, so we have this notion of like moral sort of.
 0:04: Rightness, fitness or something, moral fitness.
 0:07: I like this actually.
 0:08: , and,, you know,, maybe I don't want to continue on this.
 0:13: Oh, I'll go for a bit and we'll see what happens.
 0:15: .
 0:18: And, Yeah, maybe this is.
 0:26: I, I, I'm gonna, I'm gonna try for a bit longer.

0:00: , right, so, you know, we, we, we have,, moral fitness and we also like, we, you know, we have this notion of like, like spiritual progress of transformation of spiritual growth.
 0:13: I mean, like,, it's like terrible language, but we, you know, like a normal ordinary sense of just like maturity, which is like ordinary human maturity, right?
 0:21: , and it's like, it's like not totally clear what's going on there.
 0:26: I'm like pretty poorly read in, in like, you know, the Kegan level shit, right?
 0:29: But like, it's like, yeah, right, so there's a there's a thing here that's important,.
 0:37: Sorry.
 0:38: , what did I want to say here?
 0:45: ,, right, OK.
 0:52: And also, and so also there's some sense of like, OK, like, you know, this is like one of these sort of big contentions, you know, politically at any levels is like, OK, well, cultural relativism or something, like, oh, like what what what is actually like the point,, like, like it's not what is the point rather, it's just like,, you know.
 1:09: They're like different perspectives.
 1:11: Is there like, like, is there a sense in which we can sort of like arrive at a right answer and and also just for oneself privately?
 1:18: Like, is there a sense in like, like what does it mean to be able to sort of like rightly evolve towards like a better sense, like like like like better knowing.
 1:30: And better also like enactment of one's values, right?
 1:35: And and that's maybe like that's just like one frame like I, I, I'm not necessarily married to that way of putting it, but like generally like this evokes the the domain that I'm trying to get at and there's like a lot of different ways that people like relate to and understand this domain, which is absolutely a like vital part of like human society, human experience, psychology, etc.

0:00: OK, now at this point I think I mostly just want to hint at like like I, I could say like a sentence obliquely that's like something about there are better and worse answers here.
 0:11: , and, and then, and I'll, I'll get to it later, and that's mostly what I want to say about spiritual rationality, I guess part of the thing here is something like.
 0:20: , Yeah, OK, so there there are more things I wanna say.
 0:25: It's like some part of the point here is like this word this this language is unfortunate.
 0:30: I'm choosing it partly just to be like cheeky, which is fine,.
 0:36: , but part of it also is to say like there is some important like, yeah, there's a third leg here, right?
 0:44: And that that that is in fact left out and that's needed and that if it's not mentioned in the as a sort of like there is some rational part of it, like there's a sense of like rightness.
 0:54: There's there there is a rightness that is possible.
 0:57: It's not clear what that is,, but like there's a rightness that is possible and it's not just arbitrary,, and it's, and it's probably a lot less arbitrary than music is, right?
 1:08: That's the sense.
 1:09: That's, that's a really important thing.
 1:11: It's not just like culturally sort of locally contingent.
 1:14: , as much as like music is not, it's like unclear how arbitrary music is like we might we characterize it is singularly arbitrary, but like maybe it's like, you know, you're like prime number of stacks of stacks of.
 1:33: Of,.
 1:41: Of rocks is like, you know, Elio likes to talk about it's like, oh yeah, like I, I do think at some level there's gonna be like some kind of a grammar to musics.
 1:50: I'm not sure it's mostly conjecture on my part.
 1:53: Like there's that there's like a whatever universal grammar of music in the universal grammar in the Chomsky sense,.
 1:59: , but it's like not, it's not clear how far that goes.
 2:03: I am pretty confused about this point,.
 2:08: Anyway, but yeah, so there there is like there is sort of like there's some sense of there is spiritual transformation that is like not desirable, right?
 2:19: There is moral transformation that is not desirable.
 2:22: There are things that can be construed as virtues that we would consider unvirtues or that we would consider at least like harmful notions and so on, right?
 2:30: And like a lot of cultural change in the last like.
 2:34: At least like unless at least like 500 years, it's unclear if this is true at the scale of like 3000 years has been, you know, like what, what are the vir, what are the right ways of construing virtue?
 2:45: What are the right ways of construing ethics and such that and also, and, and this is also a point and I'm gonna get to like, this is why everyone cares about transferring to practice, which I'm gonna get to is like there is.
 2:57: ,, you know, there's like.
 3:03: , What if it's gonna be wrong practice, we're gonna get to wrong practice, but,, you know, for, for now, I'll leave it there.
 3:12: And maybe I'll actually one thing I wanted this just a note here is like I think I might end up wanting to like link forward in the text, right?
 3:20: Like it might just, it might not be it's like it's like it will be a linear order and it will also link, there will be like sort of like dense linkage within the ordering.

0:00: OK, and then rational spirituality is like, OK, so there is this domain which is spirituality, which I'll probably define afterwards unfortunately.
 0:11: Again, there's no way to write this, this thing doesn't go in a linear order.
 0:13: There's like a complicated network and like it will be in an order in the like apparent, you know, whatever, but like that's fine.
- [x] 0:20: Actually, also that's a note that I wanna, what I want to leave here is like probably introduction should say, by the way, the thing is, is in an order because it has to be presented in an order, but it's actually just like the things all link back and forth and don't worry about it.
 0:32: , Yeah, I do.
 0:36: I, I will want to say that.

[ I think I also want to say like, yeah, there's the sacred, there's visions, there's psychedelic experiences, there's no-self, there's all this stuff and it's not clear how it squares with our existing ontology, with our metaphysics, etc]
  [ do those have to change? people say a bunch of crazy things and it's not clear what updates to make]
- [ ] I might want to link to that old like "anti quack" website ("quackwatch"?) where he's like, yeah, all meditation is bad, it's all just dulling the mind

0:00: All right, OK, so the first one, rational spirituality [sorry, spiritual rationality] is right, is this the thing of like, how do we engage in this process of like moral growth, of like apprehension of value, of goodness, of rightness,.
 0:14: , sort of like rightly, how do we do so rightly?
 0:19: Something like that.
 0:19: And I think rightly is nice cause it's a little bit old fashioned, it's not clear what it means, and it's not correct, and I think correct evokes the wrong things, but OK, so that that's rational spirituality or there's so that's sorry that's spiritual rationality.
 0:30: And then we have rational spirituality, which is, OK, so there is this domain of spirituality, right?
 0:36: So there's like,, you know.
 0:39: There's trauma healing stuff.
 0:42: There's like, you know, various kinds of like practices that like have like various different kinds of effects and like.
 0:51: You know, there's like mystical insight and there's like all of these perspectives and like there's a lot of disagreement about what's right or how to do stuff or anything and it's like not even clear what works and like people get stuck on bullshit and then blah blah blah blah blah and rational spirituality is OK, that.
 1:07: How do you do that rightly.
 1:10: Right?
 1:11: How do you, how do you like actually engage with the thing?
 1:15: Well, OK, right.
 1:16: And so, and this is actually like these two, they don't point in opposite directions, but they point in separate directions, right?
 1:21: It's not just,, I actually I maybe want to put like a horizontal line, horizontal rule between these two, like I'll just be like, here's one, here's the other, and then here's what I have to say about the relationship.
 1:36: So it's it's not, so it's anyway it's not just like,, you know, OK, there's,,, Sorry, where am I going with this?
 1:52: Rational spirituality.
 1:54: Yeah, so they end up having, right, they end up having this relationship, which I'll talk about later, which is something like, like, like the two feedback into one another, right?
 2:02: How do you know what's, what's right has to do with what practices you use to like apprehend what's right and what like how you go and like both partly like how well do they work, but also like And maybe this isn't such a tight argument but like anyway, right, like there is a feedback loop in terms of upon upon both of them and like a lot of traditions are like built around the construction of a feedback loop that leads in particular places,.
 2:30: .

[ so a big part of the relationship is like, spiritual practice is in many ways like, an unfolding of the nature of mind and experience, and indeed that should disclose things about the moral domain, like
you do phenomenological investigation, and oh look, you find things about the mind! you find things about feeling and relationship and experience
and indeed there's all these reports of big changes in outlook and "worldview" and feeling and optimism and like concrete action and so on, downstream of doing spiritual practices
but is that right? are we going crazy, is this stupid?]

## Spiritual Rationality: the third leg of the stool
in the first two legs it's taken as a given that one has values, and part of the claim is that in some sense
epistemic and instrumental rationality as theories are agnostic wrt your values
  (this is a bit fraught, and both of them in fact make prescriptions that are contrary to a lot of people's
  intuitions in many cases)

- [ ] "the cocksucker move here would be to call this axiological rationality, but this doesn't really help us at all, nobody knows that word"

this is maybe a fine stance if we assume that values are basically static; insofar as we're concerned with changing our *relationship* to phenomena, experience, etc etc then indeed we need a third leg here or the stool topples over!
["changes to the apprehension of one's values"]

## Rational Spirituality
so the problem here is not just, how do we evaluate changes to our values, changes to the apprehension of our values, we also care about doing it successfully!
