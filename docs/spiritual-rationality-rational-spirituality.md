There are two very different concepts which I want to distinguish here clearly, which is why they're on the same page.

## Spiritual Rationality: the third leg of the stool
in the first two legs it's taken as a given that one has values, and part of the claim is that in some sense
epistemic and instrumental rationality as theories are agnostic wrt your values
  (this is a bit fraught, and both of them in fact make prescriptions that are contrary to a lot of people's
  intuitions in many cases)

- [ ] "the cocksucker move here would be to call this axiological rationality, but this doesn't really help us at all, nobody knows that word"

this is maybe a fine stance if we assume that values are basically static; insofar as we're concerned with changing our *relationship* to phenomena, experience, etc etc then indeed we need a third leg here or the stool topples over!
["changes to the apprehension of one's values"]

## Rational Spirituality
so the problem here is not just, how do we evaluate changes to our values, changes to the apprehension of our values, we also care about doing it successfully!
