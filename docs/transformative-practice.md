title: Everybody's Into Transformative Practice
---

[
I need [often use] a general concept which I'll call "transformative practice" to refer to the entire swath including meditation

in fact, in my circles, we often just call this "practice" generically, and this usage is common among serious meditators more broadly.

yeah so basically I want to talk about practice
I'm going to call this "transformative practice", which I think is both significantly more legible than just 'practice', and is both more descriptive and less problematic than "spiritual practice", whcih isn't even necessarily what I want to refer to
and spiritual practice, imo, only *overlaps* transformative practice
ok great, so what do we want to say here

so first off, what the heck do I mean, and also why this cluster?

so, fine, there's developmental psychology, which in fact I'm quite weak in, but there's some kinds of psychological, behavioral, whatever change that a. don't occur by default in child or adult development, and b. which can be cultivated at least substantially on purpose
I think the concept ends up leaky and I don't care to be overwhelmingly precise about it but yeah, this is a fine notion
so things that are going to come to mind are medtation, therapy, whatever, maybe somebody in the room is gonna say yoga and other ppl are going to sneer
what's more interesting is the non-obvious stuff
so I said earlier there's psychological changes that don't necessarily occur as part of normal development, what's interesting is that a bunch of cultures kinda explicitly have these practices to try to bring about psychological change
often this is kind of obscured in a larger context but can be kinda the main reason
somtehing something christian monks had their like, kinda "explicit" teacher and their like, "training master" (in kinda buddhist language, I can't remember what the christians call them)
so like idk, things that come to mind here are like, when obnoxious b and c-rate universities talk about "leadership", what they're at least *wanting* to cultivate (or, well, wanting to signal) is transformative practices, and especially transformative *containers* that bring about psychological change which is conducive to leadership (whatever that means lol)
sometimes this is more legible and is about what are often called "soft skills", but often it's about "mindset" or even, sorry, lol, "energy" or whatever

mindset is really nice here and is a nice transition
I'll just mention in passing that obviously CFAR pretty explicitly was teaching and holding transformative practice, this is what they converged on (agnostic of their efficacy etc) in trying to help people achieve their fucking goals lol

so, whatever, growth mindset in public schools, again transformative practice

mental health stuff, transformative practice
if you listen to ppl like sama or graham or cowen talk about business leadership in founders, in my reading anyway there's implicitly this desire for high quality transformative practice that can produce high quality founders. unfortunately it seems like this basically doesn't exist which I guess maybe weakens my argument
	(still tho sama will be like "yeah there's a bunch of psychological development factors that are overwhelming determinants of quality as a founder etc")

fuckin church
holy shit church
so like, not always! but a huge thread in contemporary american prot spirituality is very straightforwardly transformative practice

there's more here, like, idk, ppl want to be more disciplined, they want to be fitter, idk. 
somewhere in here I could make reference to antiracist movements

## what is practice for?

[

so what is practice for?
I mean this question in a descriptive sense, as in, indeed, people are interested in transformative practice for a variety of goals or ends or values, what are these?
so some clusters that I observe:
- achievement and augmentation
- a "remedy" to a perceived malady
- devotional stuff, idk, whatever
- in the mystical realms there's some related thing like, whatever, idk. I feel honestly a bit confused about this
