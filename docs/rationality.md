- What even is rationality
- What relationship does rationality have with spirituality?
  - What hideous notion would convince you to try to combine rationality and spirituality?
    - (For that matter, is this just Bay Area horseshit?)

[ probably: if you've read the sequences, you can skip this, tho maybe it's informative to see how I go about explaining it to get what else I might have to say here]

[ prolly link to yudkowsky somewhere, maybe literally R:A-Z lol]

[probably say, "this is one angle, this is sort of opinionated" ]

[ also just give a context about yudkowsky. maybe say some about like, here's what this means to me, I'm pretty shallowly read in this but these are the distinctions that I want to make here]

### a note on words

some of what I'll discuss here is fraught unfortunately because of the [pomp] that the word 'rationality' carries. I'll say some then regarding what words are, or mean, or whatever.
- the short thing to say here is that words are just that, and within a given context we can understand  words to mean what they are defined to mean.
- obviously, of course, there is connotation, and a lot of abuse can be done by motte and bailey. nonethless, for the context of this website, when I refer to rationality (unless I mean the subculture or whatever) I mean it mostly in this narrow sense
  - (of course I get sloppy)
- some complexity here re like, wait, how can you be said to own this word rationality
  - obviously the word has a lot of pomp and smells of inappropriate taking of authority
    - an angle on this is to say, this is a useful concept, and at minimum you can take this as "a useful concept, agnostic of the name"
    - we can hold these concepts relatively lightly and notice what distinctions are made in their light etc.
      - maybe some nice image here of like, either a lense or a viewpoint. probably this is obnoxious and I'll leave it be.

- [ ]  I also want to say something here about straw vulcans

## epistemic rationality

[as I'm thinking about this I'm like, how do I explain this to karuna? how do I explain this to my brother?]
- there exists moderately correct updating, there exists succesful prediction: "epistemic rationality"
  - this can be reduced descriptively to like "if you want to arrive at answers that are predictive, then you need to make updates in such and such a way"
    - the point here is being predictive; being descriptive exhaustive is also adequate
  - something something "reality" -- [ probably link to my post here ]
  - this involves some *prescriptive* notions wrt how you go about updating, at least for some sense of prescriptive
  - what does it mean to even arrive at correct answers?
    - this is going to be challenging to some people for a number of reasons
      - [ probably this is like "blah blah this is a diversion but it's worth going into"]
      - "true" or "correct" is often used abusively to browbeat ppl, or to wield power
      - "science" as a way of seeing is seen as exclusive and exclusionary; it refuses other ways of seeing
        - this is necessary to some extent in the sense that like, any priority will end up pulling up one way of seeing or another
      - see above section [on words](#a-note-on-words)
        - and so then we understand epistemic rationality to mean, just, "how well does this track the curves of the domain, and how well (read: successfully, accurately, at a high success rate) do we predict what we actually observe
          - there's a loop here wrt perception, which we'll get to when we talk about spirituality, but nonetheless
          - indeed there are other theories of knowledge and other distinctions that can be made, in any case I want to make reference carefully to epistemic rationality, and when I say that this is what I mean

## instrumental rationality
- there exist tradeoffs, there exist choices, there exists strategy: "instrumental rationality"
  - there's a big can of weeds here wrt game theory, optimization, etc; in this respect I'm also kind of shallowly read
  - symmetrically to what we discussed with epistemic rationality, again we can interpret this definition narrowly: the goal here is indeed to achieve our goals, to successfully get what we want (well, again, this gets hairy wrt spirituality, but we're not there yet)
    - sometimes you'll also hear "satisfaction of our values"
      - even avowed rationalists are like, yes! I have rich humane values! go cry and laugh and dance and do the worthwhile things!
  - naturally, there's going to be problems here. without even getting into awakening territory here, it's just, well, should you get what you want? isn't that harmful? what about colonialism, or rape, or who knows what?
    - part of the claim here, and this is a large part of the context of the understanding of values in a rationalist frame, is that "success" or something is not narrowly success in a competitive context, despite the language that's used
      - maybe we could define it, more richly, as "robust enactment of value"
        - yeah yeah but virtue ethics too, or something. obviously this is a frame
        - I think I'm sort of sympathetic to virtue ethics and I think I have a weaker commitment to instrumental rationality as a theory
        - I think, tho, that if you can't do these sorts of calculations you're going to just leave value on the floor, etc etc
- [ ] this definition is importantly agnostic wrt your values, this is either very clean, or presents problems if you're like "wait, but this is kind of degenerate and cold and wrong"--we'll touch on this next
