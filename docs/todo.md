- [ ] clear every item with a wikilink (just search for opening `[[`) -- 2024-12-16 I've placed some of these in places where etc etc
  - [ ] unfortunately prolly you'll need to search for single brackets as well, I'm being kinda sloppy
- [ ] 2024-12-17 I kinda want to explicitly have sections that say like, "blah blah you can skip this if you have such and such context"
- [ ] 2024-12-17 remove references to specific people, eg search for 'karuna'
- [ ] 2024-12-17 get title casing consistent. rn I'm thinking I'm going to use sentence case.
- [ ] 2024-12-17 make sure all the links work, including all the fragments
  - [ ] ostensibly the build system should catch thsi but it's currently not working
- [ ] 2024-12-17 how consistent am I in reference to concepts that I define, eg especially rationality
- [ ] turn image from gemini whatever into logo + favicon
  - ![image](../static/img/Gemini_Generated_Image_7cfd3u7cfd3u7cfd.jpeg)

  - [ ] this conversation has some good images towards the end: https://gemini.google.com/app/e733c7e5f0515c9e
- [ ] it's not clear if I should link back to LW/substack, and it's not clear if I'll be publishing the thing as dhabi ibn musa or my actual name
- [ ] whech whether I actually used the vernacular/technical tab things, and if I didn't then remove the thing from the introduction about it.
