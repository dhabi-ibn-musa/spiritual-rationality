While this site presents the pages in a linear order, it wasn't really possible to structure the material fully linearly, so some pages [[many pages?]] link forward or backward. Still, it's meant to be read in the order presented, as I make distinctions that build on one another.

#### Jargon / technical sections
Some explanations begged to be explained with reference to a specific technical model, or at least riffing off of one, but I also wanted this material to remain mostly accessible. In addition, unfortunately
"technical" is often with reference to  very different disciplines and traditions, so I expect most people not to find these explanations that helpful. Therefore, these sections are presented with a choice of a more accessible, and a more technical or just abstruse explanation.

<TechnicalTabs>
    <TabItem {...vernacular()}>
    You can click on the other tab to view a more in-depth (but jargon-laden) explanation. Your choice will be saved for sections like this within this site.
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem {...technical()}>
    Choices are persisted in localStorage; in addition they are persisted in the URL's query string, so that you can link to a page with a specific jargon level.
    </TabItem>
</TechnicalTabs>

#### Expandable sections

There are also expandable sections like this one, for digressions that aren't vital to the main text.
<details>
    <summary>Click here for some tasty details...</summary>

    (Or not so much, in this case.)
</details>
