Mystical and contemplative spirituality has in the West come in, out, back again, out once more, and (no really) back into fashion again. This time around it's with a veneer of scientism, with its concomitant confusions. Even the most "cutting edge" practice and theology among Western Buddhists is sloppy on the metaphysics, usually ineffective, and sometimes harmful. 

This critique doesn't just apply to Buddhists of course, but I'm poorly equipped to talk about Sufis or Hasidim or the New Age, though I think my arguments do apply in general. 

From the other side of the aisle, so to speak, I see those allied explicitly or just ~ *energetically* ~ with "Rationalism" as making mostly the obverse mistakes. This crowd generally relies on a narrow and overly reified metaphysics, and often have a shallow capacity for introspection.

The unholy love-child of these two ideologies is where I find myself, buffeted by, to me, what looks like insanity on both sides. I'd like to build up a framework to bridge the various discourses I've got a foot in, and which can hopefully contribute to meaningful cultural progress, such as that's possible at all.

I'll try to lay out what I think "right answers" can and can't mean in this domain, and I have some ideas about the direction in which we'll find right answers, or decide to stop looking for answers to wrong questions. I don't believe I've answered almost any of my own questions in particular, but nonetheless I believe it can be highly generative to say "not this, not that, none of these."

****

I'll make some more concrete claims at the outset:

I think that almost everyone making strong claims (positive or negative) about spirituality is overconfident and usually making ontological or metaphysical errors. Often people willfully come to false beliefs about themselves and the world, *or* dismiss clear evidence about the breadth and depth of experience.
  
Despite what is said in either direction, I think it remains that we don't have dispositive evidence about a large swath of claims about enlightenment, consciousness, or even rebirth&mdash;though I'm still quite skeptical of the most of them.

I am not aware of frameworks or theories that are adequate for bridging the gap between spiritual and physical phenomena in a way that does justice to either, nor for distinguishing "correct" or "better" spiritual traditions and claims. My *suspicion* is that this will boil down to some fundamental metaphysical-epistemological problems [ for which there may be no satisfactory formal solutions.] There will however be provisional, pragmatic answers.

Lastly, I think most spiritual traditions, and unfortunately most cultures in general, propagate memetic, epistemic, and metaphysical harms. Sometimes these are good choices under steep tradeoffs, but I believe that we've largely obscured what "good" can or ought to mean, and we need cultures of spiritual practice that are able to bear or transform the costs of shedding preference falsification, dissociation, and submission as fundamental cultural and spiritual techniques.
