- I see people making metaphysical errors
- this is true on "both sides of the aisle"
- we're having something of a resurgence, at least within whatever weird bubble I'm in
- unfortunately I haven't actually solved any problems in particular
  - nonetheless it's generative to say "not this, not that, none of these"
- I'm also going to lay out what a "right answer" can even mean in this domain
- I have some things to say about the direction in which to look

[ I'll make some claims at the outset

(actually I'm not quite sure waht goes here)
- almost everyone making strong claims (positive or negative) about spirituality is overconfident or making ontological or metaphysical errors
  - it remains that we don't have dispositive evidence about a large swath of claims
- we also don't have frameworks for distinguishing between various claims
  - a lot of this boils down to some fundamental metaphysical-epistemological problems, which afaik are unsolved
  - there are going to be provisional, pragmatic answers but still

### Influences and inspiration
Blah blah, a bit cringe, yet. In any case, the people who belong here are [Yudkowsky] [Chapman], [Burbea], and [Lippmann]. I also owe a debt of some kind to my time with [Soryu](prolly link to his old forall page lol)
[[fix these links]]

### Features on this website
#### Jargon / technical sections
Some explanations begged to be explained with reference to a specific technical model, or at least riffing off of one, but I also wanted this material to remain mostly accessible. In addition, unfortunately
"technical" is often with reference to  very different disciplines and traditions, so I expect most people not to find these explanations that helpful. Therefore, these sections are presented with a choice of a more accessible, and a more technical or just abstruse explanation.

<TechnicalTabs>
    <TabItem {...vernacular()}>
    You can click on the other tab to view a more in-depth (but jargon-laden) explanation. Your choice will be saved for sections like this within this site.
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem {...technical()}>
    Choices are persisted in localStorage; in addition they are persisted in the URL's query string, so that you can link to a page with a specific jargon level.
    </TabItem>
</TechnicalTabs>

#### Expandable sections

There are also expandable sections like this one, for digressions that aren't vital to the main text. 
<details>
    <summary>Click here for some tasty details...</summary>

    (Or not so much, in this case.)
