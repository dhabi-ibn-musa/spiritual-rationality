- [ ] logo is maybe something riffing off of the hpmor cover but like, also the buddha
- [ ] 2024-12-16 [re ontological problem, grounding, reification, something something] "their solution to which has been to elide this problem entirely"
- [ ] scott something something https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/08/28/contra-askell-on-moral-offsets/ https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/19/nobody-is-perfect-everything-is-commensurable/
- [ ] 2024-12-14 https://x.com/JakeOrthwein/status/1677056760446853123 something something meaning
- [ ] 2024-12-14 "a lot of spiritual claims don't have any more substance than 'this experience is awesome!' -- which is absolutely legitimate, and indeed, awesome, in both senses, but nonetheless"
- [ ] 2024-12-14 "one weird trick!" models of suddenist transformation
- [ ] https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/friendly-and-hostile-analogies-for --reality and discrimination re "taste"
	- 2024-12-12 so there's not that much in here that's that good, it's fine and he basically gets the correct answer
	- [ ] I probably want to have a note referring to this in the "types of correctness" post that he's making ~type errors here
	- [ ] followup: https://www.sympatheticopposition.com/p/contra-scott-on-taste
- [ ] 2024-10-21 "people talk about buddhism as though it has basically solved or else abrograted almost all of philosophy"
	- [ ] "I'm working from a relatively shallow reading but no one else is even trying"
- [ ] Duncan apparently left a like quoted comment on my layering post
- [ ] 2024-08-02 various voice memos from the last two weeks, might collect more as well
	- [ ] 2024-09-10 there were more that I recorded after this, there are in google drive in some "urecorder" folder
- [ ] 2024-12-13 https://open.spotify.com/episode/7COvb7CQ1lPF0njSfYXu2u?si=c6KYo9RCSHOWspJNafmpLA&t=1892 dwarkesh interview with Carlsmith is very good and relevant, listening to it now I'm like oh I have a bunch of ideas re the sequence that are relevant
- [ ] [[misc sequence notes]]
- [ ] read the religious epistemology section in robert audi's epistemology book
  - 2024-12-19 I think I tried and it kinda sucked 
- [ ] [[2024-08-22 PM 03.33 some notes re sequence]]
- [ ] Listening to the dwarkesh interview with Joe Carl Smith (late Aug 24) and he ~1:30 brings up moral metaphysics in a way that feels relevant
- [ ] 2024-10-16 (a month ago?) maybe title: "spiritual rationality and rational spirituality" the take here being like, spiritual rationality is the third leg in addition to epistemic and instrumental rationality, but then also rational spirituality is the application of two legs to spirituality
- [ ] https://x.com/JakeOrthwein/status/1677056760446853123 "existential commitment"
  - so I think it would be helpful also to read through this thread, there's a bunch of stuff to comment on here
    - [ ] actually prolly just scrolling through some acx posts, through twitter etc would probably go a long way to establish stuff to be like "this is what I'm criticizing, here's why it's confused"
- [ ] https://open.spotify.com/episode/4qezz7jVYmH67aBcYcrgOP?si=6b78bc1aa4f04cfe ~ 43:00 samo depicts the "west coast buddhist" perspective nicely -- in particular about how it's become "a kind of consensus"
- [ ] I kinda want to do like, "here's a full autism aside" that's like a dropdown, in addition to the tabbed thing
- [ ] 2024-12-20 maybe the logo should be like Q on a lotus or something, or actually just the interrobang on a lotus

  * generative assumptions vs definitive ontologies. physics, reductionism, etc.
  * metaphysical harms
  * reification and perverse ontological reductionism
	* "looking for a reliable single reification"
		* peter singer, utilitarianism etc

  * phenonmenological metaphysics, p14l ontology
	* "non-propositional semantics"
  * correctness
	* different correctness types, compound correctnesses. optimality, preferability, fitness, loss, fitness in a schema, etc.
  * everyone is concerned with transformative practice
