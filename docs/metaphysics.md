*Topics in this section:*

- What is Metaphysics?
- What consequence does metaphysics have on rationality?
  - (For that matter, is this just Bay Area horseshit?)
- 

- [ ] at some point go look up what definition of metaphysics burbea uses, look in the transcription google doc
- [ ] Some of what we're encountering here is just the endless doctrinal bickering between schools, probably could make reference to some ancient Christian heresies here, but also there's a question to be asked in principle re like, can this be decided at all? What are the consequences of deciding it? -- I'm also leaving out like, blah blah , [ hm unclear but there are consequences somewhere downstream?]
