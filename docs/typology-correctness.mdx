[ 2024-12-17 so I think this one is a particular challenge because I really want to go into detail here but hm]

[ again, how would I explain this to karuna, and how would I explain this to avi, and how to say hm john]
  [ I like that as three ppl to target]
  [ I think I want this one to mostly stand on its own and not have a ton of dependencies]

- people often kind of sloppily use words like "true" or "wrong" or "bad", or discuss matters of taste as being objective
  - I'm confused what's going on here, and I don't quite have an adequate solution, but what follows is a sketch of a certain set of distinctions, which I'll use for explaining problems and errors later
  - as with the discussion in the rationality page [on words](./rationality#a-note-on-words) we can hold these relatively lightly, and notice what distinctions they make. this applies to the whole frame I'm going to present, it's not meant to be taken as authoritative, *but* it constructs and makes salient certain distinctions etc
- I think usually they're pretty confused

- [ ] read the stuff linked in https://x.com/JakeOrthwein/status/1677056760446853123 very relevant
  - this is more relevant to the reification posts but yeah

#### old notes
[
probably link to scott's aesthetics post here
probably also hm
	there was a post replying to scott titled like "contra scott" something which tyler cowen resposted in the following week or two (I think the link was in one of his daily notes, and titled "on taste") -- this was pretty bad and worth reacting to maybe

I want to make some conceptual distinctions wrt different kinds of "correctness"
I want to cover everything from notions like "a correct theorem" to "you made the wrong choice" to "you played that (piece of music) wrong"

[fwiw I think my concept of entropy *might* be backwards]

[

We can start naturally with mathematical truth. What's "natural" about starting with math is that it's ontologically extremely sparse, and claims in mathematics are (relative to everything else) very low entropy.

A mathematical [model?] establishes a small number of atoms, [and something like implicitly assumes some laws of combination and inference]

[ I have a realy weak background in mathematical logic, my sense here is that you also have logical theories in which a mathematical model is embedded, or something? I'm thinking of like, do you allow for induction, do you allow for certain kinds of combinations or something?
ugh, whatever, I can make this claim probably without getting into any of that
]
furthermore mathematical propositions are exactly qualified, they are [always equivalent to] "if an object has such and such a property, then these consequences do obtain."
what's convenient about this is that it can be basically unjustified with respect to any of the rest of the world: so long as the inferences are valid, we're gucci
we can end up expressing more complex notions of correctness in a similarly qualified way, but in math it's much more explicit

### compoundness
some correctness types have to be defined in terms of multiple ontologies, I'm going to refer to these as "compound" and sometimes as "more" or "less" compound

## empiricism
[
empirical truth (or, well, when we're being precise we often don't want to say "truth" but rather want to [talk about "empirical claims with high confidence"]) requires a. that we make reference to a physical reality, however construed, (which makes this type compound) and b. to provide a bunch of evidence to
