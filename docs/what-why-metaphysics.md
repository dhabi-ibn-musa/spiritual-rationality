*Topics in this section:*

- What is Metaphysics?
- What consequence does metaphysics have on rationality?
  - (For that matter, is this just Bay Area horseshit?)
-

- [ ] at some point go look up what definition of metaphysics burbea uses, look in the transcription google doc
- [ ] Some of what we're encountering here is just the endless doctrinal bickering between schools, probably could make reference to some ancient Christian heresies here, but also there's a question to be asked in principle re like, can this be decided at all? What are the consequences of deciding it? -- I'm also leaving out like, blah blah , [ hm unclear but there are consequences somewhere downstream?]

For a long time I found the term metaphysics [bascically obnoxious] and I assumed that anyone who used the term was a [codger, wanker] and probably profoundly confused. I've come to use the concept a lot, and I think it captures nicely some distinctions which I don't have any other languague for. I [want to lay out how metaphysics relates to metaethics, how it relates to the construction of view, and eventually how [ this relates to epistemic inadequacies -- idk about this one tbh ] ]

## What is metaphysics?
- [ ] Look in the Rob burbea Google doc, search for his definition of metaphysics
[
I'm mostly oblivious of the history of the term
I'm going to use rob burbea's definition
	iirc this is like "ontology, cosmology, and epistemology"
a nice way of thinking about this is just like "all of your hyperpriors"
what's more interesting is that metaphysics is often soft and implicit, so often one has thought through pieces of this but not quite how they fit together, and very often not how they interact to affect what other kinds of inferences one makes
[My suspicion is that I've sloppily rederived concepts that people have been talking about for a century or two at least, but I continue to see people making what appear to be the same mistakes, and so I'm confident that the thrust of my argument still needs to be heard by a bunch of ppl in the scene]

[ often also people are doing a lot of deference]

the kinds of people who use the word metaphysics are often using it to justify (to me, and likely to the reader) apparent nonsense
this is especially true b/c people who need to make reference to it have a highly nonstandard one!


### yes, you too
your views constitute a metaphysics by this definition
many-words, tegmark level 4,
	but also scientifically uncontentious claims like evolution, time since the big bang, etc.
somewhere in here we care about computational theory of consciousness, mind upload
reductionist materialism!
	[I'm going to make a different a subtler critique of reductionist materialism, but I want to stress that this is a huge part of the rationalist metaphysics!]
these all have big consequences a bunch of other inferences we want to make, intuitions we have about the nature of value and the way we construt theories of value
	[maybe talk about utilitarianism?]
these are modern views!
	modern doesn't mean wrong, doesn't mean "a fad and unjustified", it's to say, indeed these are views and they have consequences in this subtle way on the kinds of inferences we are prone to make
	there's something finer here almost phenomenologically, being-and-seeming-of-the-world stuff.
		don't see this talked about!
		this is all part of the construction of "view" [[view]]
		*** because it becomes being-and-seeming, it's not mostly questioned ***
		*** furthermore when it is questioned it's justified in terms that don't add up to the being-and-seeming **
			(non-rats are vulnerable to this criticism as well, of course)

## metaphysics and metaethics
a big part of the consideration here is that a metaphysics is obviously (to me, lol) going to be upstream of metaethics.
this is often concrete: if there's rebirth or heaven, that matters, if there's spirits that matters, if there's karma that matters
	if there's merit, that matters! this is of course one of the fundamental problems in western philosophy in the last while: if reductionist materialism, how do we justify our (ordinary, mundane) ethical notions?
	and reductionist-materialism has a big effect on this, etc.
but also because being-and-seeming, again, these are hyperpriors, etc
