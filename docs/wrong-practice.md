My previous post on correctness typologies [ 2024-12-19 I'm not sure if that's what I'm gonna call it, and I might change the url] was meant to establish some distinctions around different kinds of "wrong" or "improper" ideas or actions. Whatever claims I make in this post are meant to be understood narrowly in the framework of correctness that I establish there.

I'll be explicit: I think there is such a thing as "wrong practice", and that much transformative and spiritual practice taught currently is wrong practice. First, however, I want to be clear about which kinds of "wrong" I think even apply in this domain, and which I mean in this case.
